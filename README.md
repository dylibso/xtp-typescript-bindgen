# XTP Plugin Bindgen

> *Warning*: This is experimental and is still in the alpha phase.
> Changes will be made without warning. Please wait before you start writing new bindgens.

This repository houses the prototype for bingden for typescript plug-ins in XTP.
It's based on the [XTP Schema](https://docs.xtp.dylibso.com/docs/host-usage/xtp-schema)
as the driving document. This document will be used to generate code and documentation
for plug-in systems and is specifically tailored to [Extism](https://extism.org/) at the moment.

## Building

An XTP gen template is distributed as a zip file with a `plugin.wasm`, `config.yaml`, and a `templates`
directory of template files. To build this "bundle" run the `bundle.sh` command:

```
./bundle.sh
```

To test you can use the XTP CLI and `plugin init`. You just need to point it at
a valid [XTP Schema](https://docs.xtp.dylibso.com/docs/host-usage/xtp-schema) file:

```
xtp plugin init --schema-file ./tests/schemas/fruit.yaml --template ./bundle --path myplugin -y
```

> *Note*: If you have not installed the xtp cli:
> curl https://static.dylibso.com/cli/install.sh | sudo sh
